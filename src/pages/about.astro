            Hey There, I'm a college student and I do freelancing on the
            side while juggling with my studies.

            I've been into front-web development for nearly 2 years, and
            I've enjoyed creating web applications that provides a good user
            experience to the users.

          <Paragraph>
            When I'm not into coding I like to dive myself in the world of
            User Interface and User Experience as it helps me to create a
            much more better user experience to the users as well as create
            a more valuable product in the market.

          When working on a project I tailor my approach to the problem that
          I'm trying to solve, as one tool does not work for everybody. I
          always strive to achieve the best results for who I'm currently
          working.

            I focus on building approaches which scale to help the growth of
            the product. Here's my go to stack when I'm building a project,
            I'm always open to adding more or changing as long as it helps
            the product requirement.
