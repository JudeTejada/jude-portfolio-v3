Valuable lessons that I had learned working on a previous project from a previous client and I wanted to share it with you hoping you could learn something from my experience.

## Ask a lot of questions and I mean a lot

During the meeting with a designer he presented to me a redesign of the website one thing that I had failed to do from the start was I didn't ask a lot of questions as I had thought to myself that the mockup is all I need but to my surprise, it had not turned out smoothly I was asking a lot of questions on him at the chat so many times questioning him about the functionalities, the flow, etc when this could have been solved if I had just asked questions early on. Another thing was that after I had implemented the redesign of the website the client had told me that there were a lot of things that he didn't expect it to look like and then again this could have also been solve if I had simply asked questions, lesson learned to ask a lot of questions.

## Refactor code and more refactor

As this was my first time working on someone else code, it was truly a nightmare just by looking at the code there weren't any comments to provide context to the code that was written to tell you the truth it was a total mess, to begin with. One thing that I had learned from this experience was that I was able to gain the skill of refactoring someone else code as for this project there had been developers working on that project that had come and go. Before I dive into the project I like to do some research first to help me navigate and help my process more smoothly when it comes to refactoring someone else code.

After doing some research, here's the process that helped me refactoring someone else code:

1. Take each step one at a time a
2. Understand how things work, add comments on each function as this will help you gain a better understanding of how an individual connects together.
3. Once you're able to understand how things work that's when you can start changing some code.

## A valuable lesson that I had learned

There are times that when you are working on a project and you just feel that you're not growing as to what you're expecting it to be, and this is what I had felt when I was working on a previous project not until I had a bump myself to a video on Youtube that had brought me to realize one thing. I was indeed growing it's just that I can't feel it yet at the moment so I decided to take a step back for a moment and think about the things that I had learned while working on this porject and one of it was my skill in problem-solving had dramatically increased as well as I had also gained another skill and it's reading someone else code. If you're curious about the video that I had watched here's the [link](https://youtu.be/sKlKOfQfkbM).

## Closing thoughts

If you had read the article until the end I want to let you know that we are always growing day by day and it's okay if you don't feel that you're not feeling it yet what's important is to have faith in yourself and from time to time take a step back and see how far you had grown.
