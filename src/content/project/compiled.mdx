## Overview

Compiled is a side project that I had built using Next.js and the new incredible tool, [Notion API](https://www.google.com/search?q=notion+Api&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) as my database. This project aimed to explore and learn about Notion API and have fun along the way. I store Images on Cloudinary and paste the URL into my notion database.

Its main functionality includes:

- Submit a link that'll be sent in the Notion database
- Display different resources by category

## Conclusion

Using Notion API as my database has been a great and smooth experience overall, Overall Notion API can be a great alternative to using it as CMS or a database for content type websites.

## Tidbits:

- [Vercel OG generator](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions/og-image-generation) is another cool technology that I had recently discovered, it let's you build a open graph image with just using html css, I recommend that you'll check it out
